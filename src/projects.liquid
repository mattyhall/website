            Timmy is a timesheets application I wrote to allow me to track how long I was spending on projects.
            It was important that I could access it any where as I worked on multiple different devices in
            different locations, so I decided to write it as a web app. I had some previous experience with React
            but choose Ember for this project, with a REST backend written in Rust using Rocket (the web
            framework) and Diesel (the ORM).
        </p>

        <p>
            Its features include:
            <ul>
                <li>Creating projects</li>
                <li>Timing "activities" using a stopwatch</li>
                <li>Adding previous activities using human dates (eg. two hours ago)</li>
                <li>
                    Visualising the information, such as hours spent on each day of the week or each hour
                    of the day, most common tags and a gantt chart (done using Chart.js)
                </li>
                <li>User authentication</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
